    <h2>Freethrow?</h2>

    <p>
      I am a control systems engineer with a PhD in Systems Automation, trade
      analyst, freelance developer, former energy scientist, and data analyst.
    </p>
    <p>
      My curriculum
      <a href="/cv.pdf">is available in PDF</a>
      , but I tend to write here about interesting things and projects.
    </p>

    <h3>What can I do for you?</h3>
    <p>Web Development Projects from start to finish:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Project requirements analysis</li>
      <li>Discussion and details</li>
      <li>Features (data flow, data endpoints, connections, ETL)</li>
      <li>SQL or NoSQL database design (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase)</li>
      <li>
        Technology Stack (Node.js, python, Express.js, Koa.js, Django, Flask,
        Vue.js, Svelte.js etc)
      </li>
      <li>Fully Responsive and mobile or desktop first</li>
      <li>CSS3 or SASS design (Flexbox, Grid, with or without frameworks)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Data Science Projects from start to finish</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Data gathering and organization</li>
      <li>Data cleaning</li>
      <li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
      <li>Machine Learning Algorithms</li>
      <li>Data Visualization (D3.js, python, Tableau)</li>
      <li>Data Driven Product Design</li>
      <li>Office automation - reporting - visualization</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Visualization.site?</h3>
    <p>
      My old site still lives on
      <a href="http://www.freethrow.rs">freethrow.rs</a>
      and I bought this domain on a sale. I thought it was cool and since most
      of my work is mostly in the visualization field I made another place for
      myself on the net.
    </p>
    <h3>Stack?</h3>
    <p>
      I used this opportunity to try out a combination of strapi - a fast API
      builder based on Koa.js deployed on Heroku with a MongoDB collection as a
      database. The images are hosted on Cloudinary and the app/website itself
      is built with Svelte.js, a wonderful JS compiler.
